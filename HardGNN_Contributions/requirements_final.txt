# Final Requirements for Google Colab Pro+ Compatibility
# These versions are tested and confirmed to work with Python 3.10+ on Google Colab
# For TensorFlow and NumPy, we rely on Colab's default versions. Script installs/upgrades others.

# Core scientific computing libraries
matplotlib>=3.5.0
# numpy: Relies on Google Colab's default version.
scipy>=1.12.0  # NumPy 2.x compatible

# TensorFlow: Relies on Google Colab's default version.
# ml-dtypes: Relies on Google Colab's default version (often a TF dependency).

# Protobuf compatibility (important for TensorFlow)
protobuf>=3.19.0,<4.25.0  # Avoid version conflicts

# Additional helpful packages
pandas>=1.3.0  # For data manipulation if needed
scikit-learn>=1.0.0  # For additional ML utilities
