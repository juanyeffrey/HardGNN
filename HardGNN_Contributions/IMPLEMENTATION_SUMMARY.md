# HardGNN Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Final Implementation Status

This document summarizes the final state of the HardGNN implementation, which enhances the SelfGNN recommendation model with a hard negative sampling strategy, designed for Google Colab using TensorFlow 1.x (via `tf.compat.v1`) within a TF2 environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture & Features

### Main Model: `HardGNN_model.py`
- **SelfGNN Foundation**: Includes all original SelfGNN functionalities (Multi-Graph GNN, LSTM Sequence Modeling, Multi-Head Attention).
- **Hard Negative Sampling**: Integrated InfoNCE contrastive loss (œÑ=0.1, K=5, Œª=0.1).
- **TensorFlow 1.x Compatibility**: Operates using `tf.compat.v1` for TF1-style graph execution.
- **Colab Optimization**: Designed for Google Colab, with considerations for its environment.

### Key Enhancements & Features:
1. ‚úÖ **Multi-Graph GNN Construction** based on time-series data.
2. ‚úÖ **LSTM for Temporal User Behavior** modeling.
3. ‚úÖ **Multi-Head Attention** for capturing user-item interaction patterns.
4. ‚úÖ **Cosine Similarity-based Hard Negative Sampling** to select challenging negatives.
5. ‚úÖ **InfoNCE Contrastive Loss** with temperature scaling for effective learning.
6. ‚úÖ **Validated Hyperparameter Integration**: Uses original SelfGNN validated parameters for base model, with HNS on top.
7. ‚úÖ **Dataset Agnostic Design**: Supports multiple datasets (Yelp, Amazon, Gowalla, MovieLens) via a single script configuration.

## üîß Key Technical Adjustments & Fixes

### 1. TensorFlow 1.x Execution in TF2 Environment
- ‚úÖ Utilized `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` and `tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()`.
- ‚úÖ Adapted TensorFlow API calls to their `tf.compat.v1` equivalents (e.g., `tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.*`, `tf.compat.v1.layers.layer_norm`, `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer`, `tf.compat.v1.placeholder`).

### 2. Parameter Management for Sequential Cell Execution in Colab
- ‚úÖ Addressed potential reuse of global parameters from `Utils/NNLayers_tf2.py` across different model instantiations (e.g., validation cell vs. training cell).
- ‚úÖ Implemented `tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()` before model creation in new logical sections.
- ‚úÖ Ensured `NNLayers_tf2.reset_nn_params()` is called to clear layer parameters, preventing state leakage between distinct model runs within the same script/notebook flow.

### 3. Hard Negative Sampling Integration
- ‚úÖ Implemented cosine similarity for selecting top-K hard negative samples.
- ‚úÖ Integrated InfoNCE loss with configurable temperature (œÑ), number of negatives (K), and loss weight (Œª).
- ‚úÖ Ensured HNS parameters are applied on top of dataset-specific validated base model hyperparameters.

## üìä Expected Outcome
- The primary goal is to replicate original SelfGNN paper results while demonstrating the incremental benefit of the added hard negative sampling strategy.
- Performance improvements (HR@10, NDCG@10) are anticipated over a baseline SelfGNN without HNS.
- The contrastive loss component should reflect effective discrimination learning.

## üöÄ Primary Usage Method
- The `HardGNN_Colab_Script.py` is the central piece. Its content is intended to be copied cell-by-cell into a Google Colab notebook for execution.
- The main `README.md` provides detailed setup and execution instructions for this workflow.

This summary reflects the state of the implementation aimed at providing a robust and reproducible experimental setup for HardGNN on Google Colab.
